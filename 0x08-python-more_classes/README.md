"Python more classes" is a broad topic that refers to the advanced concepts and techniques related to object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. This includes topics such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstract classes, and interfaces.

In OOP, classes are used to define objects and their properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods), and Python provides a rich set of tools to work with classes and objects. Understanding these advanced concepts can help developers write more efficient, scalable, and reusable code.

Some popular frameworks in Python that utilize these concepts include Django, Flask, and SQLAlchemy, among others.
