0x09. Python - Everything is object
Description
This project focuses on the concept of object-oriented programming in Python. It covers topics such as objects, classes, instances, immutable and mutable objects, references, assignments, aliases, and variable identifiers. The project also includes questions about Python's specificity and the difference between immutable and mutable types.

Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All files should end with a new line
The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Project Tasks
Task 0: Answer questions about the specificity of Python
Task 1: Write a function that returns the id of an object
Task 2: What will be the result of this code?
Task 3: Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string)
Task 4: What will be the result of this code?
Task 5: Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string
Task 6: What will be the result of this code?
Task 7: Write a function that returns a copy of a list
Task 8: Given the above, what does the following code print?
Task 9: Answer questions about what Zen means
