0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping
This repository contains the code for the "0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping" project, which is part of the Holberton School curriculum. The project focuses on learning about Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Python using the SQLAlchemy library.

Project Overview
The "0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping" project is designed to introduce and practice the concepts of Object-Relational Mapping and how to interact with databases using Python and SQLAlchemy.

The project includes several tasks that cover different aspects of working with databases, including creating tables, inserting data, querying data, updating data, and deleting data using the SQLAlchemy ORM.

Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple directories and files, each serving a specific purpose. Here's an overview of the project structure:

models/: This directory contains the Python classes that define the database tables and their relationships. Each table is represented by a corresponding class.
tests/: This directory contains the unit tests for the project. It includes test cases to ensure the functionality and correctness of the implemented ORM methods.
main.py: This file is the entry point of the project. It includes sample code and usage examples of the implemented ORM methods.
README.md: This file provides an overview and instructions for the project.
